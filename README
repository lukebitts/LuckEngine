TODO LIST:
(there are @todo marks on the source code too)

Read UV Coordinates from .obj files
Make a 2D Component (to draw GUI elements using openGL)
Make a Texture Component (can read uv coordinates and apply a texture to the 3D object OR is a GUI image)
Make file loaders (Meshs and textures for now, other kind of stuff later on)

DONE LIST:

Make a Vertex Component (to wrap the drawing)
- Make a vertex type which accepts the position, the uv coordinates and the color
- Make other components to read 3D files and fill the Vertex component in a faster way than writing vertex by vertex in the source code
- Make a interpreter for a basic 3D file type (.obj)
Make file loaders (.obj loading is done)
